# 4. Sorting

## 2. Merge Sort

### Merge Sort 
The main idea is to take the input array and then split it into two approximately equal halves and for those halves, split them into approximately equal halves. And then continue to split each subarray until we can't split them anymore which would mean we have individual element left for us to then sort. The idea is to break up the original problem of sorting the entire array into sub problems. So in order for us to sort the entire array, first we can sort the first three values so we can sort the first halves of the values. And then the second half of values, we anna sort theses elements as well. But theses also have sub problems. We can split this array into half. This problem naturally lends itself to recursion. And this is clearly two branches recursion. When you have two sorted arrays, we can merge theses two arrays back into the original array, such that they are in sorted order. This is why we call it merge sort because we break it up into two sub problems and merge them back together. And we're gonna compare the values.

But now that we took original array have it sorted into a left half and right half, we can merge these portions together to make the original array sorted. 

```
int[] mergeSort(int[] arr, int s, int e){
  if(e-s+1<=1) return arr;

  m = (s+e)/2;
  mergeSort(arr,s,m);
  mergeSort(arr,m+1,e);
  merge(arr,s,m,e);

  return arr
}
```
