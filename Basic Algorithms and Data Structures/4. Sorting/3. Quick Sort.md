## 3. Quick Sort

### Quick Sort 
We're gonna pick a random value and we usally pick the right most value (pivot value). We're gonna iterate through every single value in the array except for the pivot value. We're gonna compare that value to the pivot. And every value that is less than or equal to the pivot value is going to be in the left partition of the array. And we can actually perform the partition in place that means we don't need to allocate any extra memory to do the partition. After arranging the value comparing to the pivot value, where should we put the pivot value? So the place where the pointer is at is the place where the pivot value should be. 

After we divide the array into two arrays, this is where the recursive step comes in. So we run quick sort each side and the pivot value is already sorted. We can just ignore the pivot value when we run quicksort on the sub-problem. 

In the worst case, the time complexity can be n^2, but in generall it's nlogn.
