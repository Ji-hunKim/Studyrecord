## Linked Lists
First thing to know about linked list is that they are made up of list nodes(Nodes). A list node an object that encapsulates two things at a minimum (Value + Next = pointer). The pointer is gonna tell us what is the next list node in the linked list. So this is essentially a way of connecting multiple list nodes together which forms a linked list.
