# 2. Static Arrays

## Array
Contiguous blocks of data.   
The two most comomon operations are reading to the data or writing to the data.   

> 1) Reading the data
Let's say we allocated it by calling it myarray, we don't need to know the exact address of every single value.    
Instead, we use indexes to access values.   
Since we can automatically map any index in our array to a location in memory, that means we can instantly read any value as long as we have the index for it. To represent that that's an efficient operation, we call it Big O of 1 O(1). = What this means is that in the worst case, to read a value assuming we have the index. So suppose we want to read the value at index 2, it's an instant operation.(It happens in constant time) When we access to array by index in an iterator we increment i to be one, two and we keep doing that until it equaled the length of the array.
