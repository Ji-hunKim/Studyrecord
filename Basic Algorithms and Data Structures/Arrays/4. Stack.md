# 4. Stack

## Stack
There is a common data structure in programming called a stack which typically supports three operations. You can push an element to the end of the stack. You can pop an element from the end of the stack. Or you can look at the last element in the stack meaning in this case we just read the last element without removing it like we would in pop.
