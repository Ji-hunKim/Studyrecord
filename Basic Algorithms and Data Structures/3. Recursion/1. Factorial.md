# 3. Recursion

## 1. Factorial

### Recursion
Recursion is a very important concept for data strucutres and algorithms. We're gonna start with one branch recursion. 


### Factorial 
We're gonna do so using a math formula specifically n factorial. n factorial is a shorthand of writing n times n-1 times n-2 all the way we get to the base number which is one. Now you definitely don't need recursion to do this calculation. The easiest way to do would be with a loop where we take this number and decrement it by 1 and multiply it by the result until we get all the dowon to one.

But we can also do this with recursion. Notice how 5! is the same is the same 5 times 4!. 

>n! = n X (n-1)!   

The reason it's imortant to understand it in this way is because recursion is all about sub problems. 

```
int factorial (int n) {   
  if(n<=1){
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n-1);  
}
```

If we don't have the if statement, we would continue the factorial function infinitely. We would continue to call the same function that we're inside of. It would never stop and we would never go back up to compute our original result.

Why is this taking up O(n) memory? That function is gonna take up space in memory. Each function is gonna have its own input parameter so you can  think of the funciton declaring one variable at the very least and the function itself actually takes up little bit of memory.
