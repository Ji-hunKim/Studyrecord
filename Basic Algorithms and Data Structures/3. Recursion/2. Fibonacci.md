# 3. Recursion

## 2. Fibonacci

### Fibonacci 
The first fibonacci number is 0 and second is 1. 
>F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

We know that this can be broken up into a couple sub-problemns like F(n-1) and F(n-2). And it will continue down until the base reaches F(0) and F(1).

```
int fibonacci (int n) {   
  if(n<=1){
    return n;
  }
  return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);  
}
```
